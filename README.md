# Building a DCGAN on Street View House Numbers 

__Deep Convolutional GANs__ or __DCGANs__ are specific types of GAN in which the generator and/or discriminator are build/trained using convolutional layers. The DCGAN architecture was first presented and tested by [Alec Radford](https://twitter.com/AlecRad), [Luke Metz](https://twitter.com/Luke_Metz) and [Soumith Chintala](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala) in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).

In this repository, I'm going to include my work on training a DSGAN on the [Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
. The images in this dataset are collected from Google street view.
